## FAQ

**Q: Is this mod compatible with other mods that affect seduction mechanics?**  
A: It's unlikely that a mod will be compatible if they also override `seduce_scheme.txt` and/or `court_scheme.txt`

**Q: Will this mod work for future versions of Crusader Kings III?**  
A: As long as there are no significant changes to the seduction mechanics, this mod should remain compatible with future versions.
